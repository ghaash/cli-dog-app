My notes file for cli-dog-app.

The plan is to: Create a CLI app to scrape the website bringfido.com

1. I'll be following Avi's example video from the lesson, as per I understand how to make a CLI, how to scrape, and how to output the data in a nicely viewed package from previous lessons, but I have no idea how to do it from scratch :sadface: BUT its something I've been looking really forward to and been wanting to do for a while!
2. I'll scrape bringfido.com down to that 3x8 set of tiles (there's 24 of them) and have each tile scraped so I have some nice text for the CLI, hopefully that's one level deep enough? I'll find output
3. Readme should be fairly simple, I've done those since way when back in '97
4. I'm going to forget to commit as often as I should but I will try to commit every 2-15 lines of code
5. I'm working a 9 year old laptop with a failing display (should last me until I get a job!) and for capturing myself coding might be a bit wonky? sorry. You will see an adorable furbeast in the background. Do not be alarmed. That is my puppy, POE DAMERON! He's learning how to code to (I swear. He's that smart. He learned how to open doors after watching me do it.)
6. The readme video will be a bit wonky too then I think, maybe from my phone.
7. I'm commiting now

how i envison the CLI

1. app will greet user
2. give list of options
3. user will select an options
4. cli will show selected option
